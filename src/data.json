    "question": "What project is Umutesa most proud of?",
    "answer": "Umutesa’s proudest achievement is her master’s thesis: 'Vision-Only Socially Compliant Navigation for Autonomous Robots.' This project tackled one of the most complex challenges in robotics—predicting human trajectories in crowded, occluded environments using only visual input. She developed algorithms that allowed mobile robots to navigate safely and respectfully around people, even when visibility was limited and both the robot and pedestrians were in motion. The work required deep understanding of human behavior modeling, real-time vision processing, and ethical design principles. It was a culmination of late nights, relentless debugging, and a passion for creating technology that harmonizes with human spaces.",

    "question": "What is Umutesa's approach to learning or debugging?",
    "answer": "Umutesa approaches debugging as a learning opportunity. She starts by identifying the root cause using first principles such as whether the tool/concept/algorithm is being used correctly, and consulting documentation to understand expected behavior. She believes that every bug is a clue to a deeper gap in understanding. Additionally, she uses platforms like CLion for C++ and VS Code for Python, leveraging their debugging modes to inspect variables, trace execution paths, and isolate anomalies. Her methodical approach combines intuition with discipline, and she often documents her findings to build a personal knowledge base for future reference. For her, debugging isn’t just about fixing,it’s closing the gap in understanding.",
